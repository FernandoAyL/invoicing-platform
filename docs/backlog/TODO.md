# TODO

Backlog of planned work, grouped into phases. The developer moves a task out of
here to `TOTEST.md` once implemented; on QA pass the planner moves it to
`TOCODEREVIEW.md`, and on review approval to `DONE.md`. A QA or review rejection
sends the task back here with the findings attached as a sub-bullet.

**Task IDs** are prefixed by phase: Phase 0 → `0000x`, Phase 1 → `1000x`,
Phase 2 → `2000x`, Phase 3 → `3000x`, Phase 4 (stretch) → `4000x`.

**Timeline** — target deploy end of day **Wed Jul 8** (~6 days from Thu Jul 2).

| Phase | Theme | Rough window |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 0 | Design, local env, accounts | Thu Jul 2 |
| 1 | Core app (accounting core, auth, customer invoices) + CI | Fri Jul 3 – Sat Jul 4 |
| 2 | Sync engine (QBO, idempotency, conflicts, retries) + CD | Sun Jul 5 – Tue Jul 7 |
| 3 | Terraform infra + deploy + hardening | Tue Jul 7 – Wed Jul 8 |
| 4 | Stretch / roadmap (vendor bills, refunds, reports) | beyond the 6-day target |

## Phase 0 — Design & foundations (`0000x`)

Complete — all tasks in `DONE.md`.

---

## Phase 1 — Core app + CI (`1000x`)

Goal: a working, locally-runnable app with auth and customer-invoice / payment
CRUD on a double-entry ledger, backed by Postgres, with CI green on every push.
CI is front-loaded (`10002`); from there **each task adds its own Vitest unit
tests** for the pure logic it introduces, rather than a separate testing task.

- ☐ `10003` Fastify server bootstrap: config, Postgres pool plugin, pino structured logging, health endpoint
- ☐ `10004` Auth: email/password session login, httpOnly cookie, logout, seeded users, Admin/Member roles
- ☐ `10005` Contact CRUD (customer role first): name + contact info, attachable to an invoice; maps to a QBO Customer
- ☐ `10006` Customer-invoice CRUD: create / edit / void a `Transaction` of type `customer_invoice` with line items; post balanced `LedgerEntry` rows (debit A/R, credit income) — with unit tests for invoice state transitions
- ☐ `10007` Payments: record a payment `Transaction` against an invoice; post ledger (debit bank / undeposited funds, credit A/R); derive paid / partial / unpaid status — with unit tests for status derivation
- ☐ `10008` Audit log write path: every mutating action appends to `SyncAuditLog` (entity, action, direction, outcome, user, timestamp)
- ☐ `10009` Frontend scaffold: React/Vite single app, public SSG routes (`/`, `/products`, `/pricing`), client-rendered auth routes
- ☐ `10010` Dashboard + invoice list/detail UI with inline sync status badge (synced / pending / conflict / failed)
- ☐ `10011` Chart of accounts: seed the minimal accounts the customer-invoice flow needs (Accounts Receivable, Sales Income, a bank account, Undeposited Funds); a posting helper that writes balanced `LedgerEntry` rows and rejects any transaction where Σ debit ≠ Σ credit — with unit tests for ledger balancing

---

## Phase 2 — Sync engine + CD (`2000x`)

Goal: real two-way sync against the QBO sandbox, safe under duplicate /
out-of-order events and partial failures, plus continuous deploy on merge to main.

- ☐ `20001` QBO OAuth: connect/disconnect flow, token storage in `QboConnection`, automatic token refresh
- ☐ `20002` Webhook ingestion endpoint: JSON-schema validation of inbound QBO payloads (Fastify schema), signature verification
- ☐ `20003` Refetch: when a webhook payload is incomplete, fetch full invoice/payment state from QBO before applying
- ☐ `20004` Mapping layer: entity-typed `SyncLink` resolution (`Contact` / `Account` / `Item` / `Transaction` ↔ QBO id + type), including chart-of-accounts / GL accounts
- ☐ `20005` Idempotency: event dedup by external event id, idempotency keys on writes, `ON CONFLICT` upserts — no duplicate records or repeated writes
- ☐ `20006` Outbound sync: propagate internal create/edit/void of invoices and payments to QBO
- ☐ `20007` Inbound sync: apply QBO-originated changes to internal records
- ☐ `20008` Ordering: handle out-of-order events (version/updated-at guards, skip stale writes)
- ☐ `20009` Delete-vs-void: treat delete and void as distinct actions matching QBO semantics
- ☐ `20010` Conflict detection + policy: flag invoices edited in both systems since last sync as `conflict`, no silent overwrite; resolution UI to pick the winning version
- ☐ `20011` Failure handling: retry with backoff, safe recovery from partial success (timeout after a write), failed-item state for manual retry
- ☐ `20012` Integrations page: connect/disconnect QBO, connection health, chronological sync activity log, manual retry of a failed item
- ☐ `20013` Sync engine tests: duplicate webhook, out-of-order, edited-in-both, delete-vs-void, partially-paid edit, timeout-after-write, retry-after-partial-success, pre-existing unlinked invoices
- ☐ `20014` CD (GitHub Actions, on merge to `main`): assume the GitHub OIDC CD role (no static keys) → build image → push to ECR → run DB migrations as a one-off `aws ecs run-task` (fail the deploy if they fail) → register a new task-def revision → `aws ecs update-service`. Terraform owns the service; CD owns task-def revisions — no `terraform apply` in the deploy path (see [design-decisions.md](../design-decisions.md#deploy-and-iac-boundary))

---

## Phase 3 — Infrastructure as code + deploy (`3000x`)

Goal: reproducible AWS deployment via Terraform, wired to the CD pipeline.

- ☐ `30001` Terraform: RDS Postgres, ECR repo, ECS cluster + Fargate service (with `lifecycle.ignore_changes = [task_definition, desired_count]` so CD owns image revisions without drift), VPC/networking, IAM task roles
- ☐ `30002` Terraform: Route53 record + EventBridge rule on ECS task-state-change → Lambda updating DNS to the task's public IP
- ☐ `30003` Terraform: S3 bucket + CloudFront distribution for the frontend, `/api/*` origin → Fargate
- ☐ `30004` Secrets: QBO client secret and DB creds in SSM Parameter Store / Secrets Manager, injected into the task
- ☐ `30005` Wire CD (`20014`) to the Terraform-managed ECR/cluster/service: Terraform provides only the initial task def, CD registers revisions + updates the service; DB migrations run as a pre-deploy `aws ecs run-task`
- ☐ `30009` Terraform: GitHub OIDC identity provider + narrow CD role — trust scoped to `repo:FernandoAyL/invoicing-platform` on `main`; permissions limited to ECR push, `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition`, `ecs:UpdateService`, `iam:PassRole`
- ☐ `30006` End-to-end deploy verification against the QBO sandbox
- ☐ `30007` README: setup, local run, test, and deploy instructions
- ☐ `30008` Final hardening + docs pass on tradeoff reasoning

---

## Phase 4 — Stretch / roadmap (`4000x`)

Beyond the 6-day target. Each item is **additive on the `10001` accounting core** —
a new `Transaction.type` and its postings, or a read-only query over `LedgerEntry` —
not a schema change. Vendor bills are the first to pull in if time allows.

- ☐ `40001` Vendor bills (AP): `vendor_bill` + `bill_payment` Transactions posting debit expense / credit A/P; two-way sync with QBO Bill / BillPayment
- ☐ `40002` Refunds & credit memos: `customer_credit_memo` and `vendor_credit` types with reversing postings; sync with QBO CreditMemo / VendorCredit
- ☐ `40003` Employee credit-card expenses: `expense` Transactions on a `credit_card` Account linked to an employee `Contact`
- ☐ `40004` Bank accounts & transfers: manage `bank` Accounts and `transfer` Transactions (reconciliation later)
- ☐ `40005` Financial reports: General Ledger, Trial Balance, Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet as read-only views over `LedgerEntry`
